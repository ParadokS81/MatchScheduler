# Real-time User Profile Subscription Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time user profile subscription to detect when users are kicked from teams, ensuring immediate UI updates without requiring page refreshes.

## Changes Made

### 1. App Component Modifications (`Firebase/public/js/components/app.js`)

#### Added Variables
```javascript
let currentUserUnsubscribe = null; // Track user profile subscription
```

#### New Functions

##### `cleanupUserSubscription()`
- Cleans up user profile subscription when needed
- Prevents memory leaks

##### `subscribeToUserUpdates(userId)`
- Subscribes to real-time user profile changes
- Detects when user is removed from teams
- Updates UI state accordingly
- Shows notification when user is kicked

#### Modified Functions

##### `setupStateSubscriptions()`
- Now subscribes to user profile changes when user signs in
- Calls `subscribeToUserUpdates(user.uid)` for authenticated users

##### `cleanup()`
- Now includes user profile subscription cleanup
- Ensures all subscriptions are properly disposed

## How It Works

### 1. User Sign-in Flow
```
User signs in → AuthService updates user state → App detects user state change → 
App subscribes to user profile changes via subscribeToUserUpdates()
```

### 2. Team Kick Detection Flow
```
Leader kicks player → Backend updates user's teams map → 
User profile listener detects change → App checks if currentTeam still valid → 
If not valid: Clear currentTeam, show notification, update UI
```

### 3. Real-time Update Sequence
1. **Backend Action**: `removePlayer` function removes user from team and updates their `teams` map
2. **Profile Listener**: `subscribeToUserUpdates` detects the profile change
3. **Validation**: App checks if `currentTeam` still exists in user's teams
4. **State Update**: If team is invalid, clears `currentTeam` and `teamData`
5. **UI Update**: Components re-render showing "Join/Create" state
6. **Notification**: User sees "You have been removed from the team" message

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start Emulators**:
   ```bash
   cd Firebase
   npm run serve
   ```

2. **Open Test Page**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/test-realtime.html`

3. **Sign In**: Use Google sign-in to authenticate

4. **Check Status**: Click "Check Subscription Status" to verify setup

5. **Simulate Kick**: 
   - Open Firebase Emulator UI (usually `http://localhost:4000`)
   - Navigate to Firestore
   - Find the user document in `users` collection
   - Modify the `teams` object to remove a team
   - Observe real-time updates in the test page

### Expected Behavior

#### Transfer Leadership ✅
- **Leader's View**: Sees leadership change immediately
- **New Leader's View**: Sees leadership change immediately
- **Other Members**: See leadership change immediately

#### Kick Player ✅ (Now Fixed)
- **Kicking Leader's View**: Sees player removed immediately
- **Kicked Player's View**: **Now sees removal immediately** (previously required refresh)
- **Other Members**: See player removed immediately

## Code Architecture

### Subscription Management
- **Team Subscription**: Listens to team document changes
- **User Profile Subscription**: Listens to user document changes
- **State Subscriptions**: Internal app state change listeners

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of subscription failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic cleanup on errors

### Memory Management
- Proper subscription cleanup on sign-out
- Prevention of memory leaks
- Cleanup on component destruction

## Integration Points

### DatabaseService
- Uses existing `subscribeToUser(userId, callback)` function
- Leverages resilient listener pattern
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

### StateService
- Updates user state with fresh profile data
- Triggers component re-renders
- Maintains state consistency

### UI Components
- TeamInfo component automatically updates via state subscriptions
- Team switcher updates when teams change
- Error notifications show user feedback

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Experience**: No page refreshes needed
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Users know instantly when kicked
3. **Consistent State**: UI always reflects current user permissions
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures
5. **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup prevents leaks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Toast Notifications**: Replace error banner with toast system
2. **Reconnection Indicators**: Show when reconnecting to server
3. **Offline Support**: Handle offline scenarios gracefully
4. **Batch Updates**: Optimize multiple rapid changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Subscription Not Working**: Check Firebase rules allow user document reads
2. **Memory Leaks**: Ensure cleanup functions are called properly
3. **State Inconsistency**: Verify StateService initialization order
4. **Connection Issues**: Check Firebase configuration and network

### Debug Tools

- **Browser Console**: Check for subscription errors
- **Test Page**: Use `test-realtime.html` for debugging
- **Firebase Emulator UI**: Monitor Firestore document changes
- **State Service Debug**: Access `window.stateService` in console
